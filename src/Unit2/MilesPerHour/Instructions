Lab 2d OOP Miles Per Hour
This lab was designed to teach you more about objects, input, output formatting, and the Math class.

Description:
Given a distance traveled (miles) and elapsed time (hours and minutes), calculate the speed in miles per hour.

mph = distance / time

time = hours + (minutes/60)

Hints:
you will need to do some casting in the calc
round the MPH on output - i.e. in the toString method

Submission:
Screenshot of all unit tests
Screenshot of example of console output

Sample Input/Output:
Enter the distance :: 45
Enter the hours :: 0
Enter the minutes :: 32
45 miles in 0 hour and 32 minutes = 84 MPH.

Enter the distance :: 96
Enter the hours :: 1
Enter the minutes :: 43
96 miles in 1 hour and 43 minutes = 56 MPH.

Enter the distance :: 100
Enter the hours :: 2
Enter the minutes :: 25
100 miles in 2 hour and 25 minutes = 41 MPH.

Enter the distance :: 50
Enter the hours :: 2
Enter the minutes :: 25
50 miles in 2 hour and 25 minutes = 21 MPH.
