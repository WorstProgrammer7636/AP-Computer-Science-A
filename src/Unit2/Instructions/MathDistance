Lab 2c6 math Distance
This lab was designed to teach parameter passing, value calculation, and output.

Description:
Complete the static methods in Main.java to calculate the distance between 2 points. Write a simple UI to test the methods.

You must implement the static methods according to the directions below (see comments in code):

  // given two integers x and y. returns the difference x-y
  public static int difference(int x, int y)
  {
  }

  // given an integer x returns the square
  //  do not use multiplication - use Math.pow
  public static int square(int x)
  {
  }

  // given two points on a plane, returns the distance between them
  //  You MUST call the methods difference and square above
  //  You CANNOT use subtraction and multiplication in this mehthod
  public static double distance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
  {
  }

Screenshot of example of console output

Sample Input/Output:
Enter x1: 8
Enter y1: 9
Enter x2: 2
Enter y2: 4
The distance between (8,9) and (2,4) is 7.810249675906654
