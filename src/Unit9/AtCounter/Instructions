Lab10a5 - At Counter
Description
The constructor should randomly load the characters '@' and 'â€“' into the matrix. Take a provided row and col location and count how many @ signs connect to the original location. @ signs are connected if they are connected up, down, left, and right of one another.

You MUST use a matrix. You MUST use recursion.

Algorithm Help:
 if ( r and c are in bounds and current spot is a @ )
     mark spot as visited (don't worry about changing the matrix)
     bump up current count by one
     4 recursive calls up down left right
Example:
Assume this was randomly loaded in the constructor :

@ - @ - - @ - @ @ @
@ @ @ - @ @ - @ - @
- - - - - - - @ @ @
- @ @ @ @ @ - @ - @
- @ - @ - @ - @ - @
@ @ @ @ @ @ - @ @ @
- @ - @ - @ - - - @
- @ @ @ - @ - - - -
- @ - @ - @ - @ @ @
- @ @ @ @ @ - @ @ @
If checking 0 0, you would find 5 @s are connected. If checking 9 7, you would find 6 @s are connected. If checking 0 1, you would find 0 @s are connected.

Sample Data
0 0
2 5
5 0
9 9
3 9

Sample Output
0 0 has 5 @s connected.
2 5 has 0 @s connected.
5 0 has 29 @s connected.
9 9 has 6 @s connected.
3 9 has 16 @s connected.
