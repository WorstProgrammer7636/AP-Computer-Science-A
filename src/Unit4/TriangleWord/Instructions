Lab - Triangle Words
This lab was designed to teach you how to use nested loops.

Description
Use nested loops to print out a triangle word pattern. For example if the word is:

hello

Then the output should be:

    h
   e e
  l   l
 l     l
ollehello

Note, there are no spaces at the end of each line, so your algorithm must account for that. This algorithm is challenging and requires nested loops to implement.
