Lab8a12 - Tic Tac Toe
Description
Read in the values for a tic tac toe game and evaluate whether X or O won the game. The first number in the files represents the number of data sets to follow. Each data set will contain a 9 letter string. Each 9 letter string contains a complete tic tac toe game.

Algorithm Help:
The determineWinner method goes through the matrix to find a winner. It checks for a horizontal winner first. Then, it checks for a vertical winner. Lastly, it checks for a diagonal winner. It must also check for a draw. A draw occurs if neither player wins.

You will read in each game from a file and store each game in a matrix. The file will have multiple games in it.
