Lab 5a1 Triangle
This lab was designed to teach you more about objects, input, output formatting, and the Math class.

Description
Calculate the area of a triangle given the values for all three sides.

perimeter = a + b + c

s = perimeter / 2

area=sqrt(s(s–a)(s–b)(s–c))

You must create a simple UI where the user can enter arbitrary sides. If the user enters 0 for side A, exit the program.

Submission
Pass the unit tests in replit

Input
3 3 3
7 8 9
10 9 11

Enter side A :: 7
Enter side B :: 8
Enter side C :: 9
Triangle: 7x8x9, has area == 26.83

Enter side A :: 10
Enter side B :: 9
Enter side C :: 11
