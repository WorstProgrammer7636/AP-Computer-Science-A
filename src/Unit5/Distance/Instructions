Complete all the methods in the class including toString.

Hint: Formating Output
toString should format the distance with three decimal places.  You can do this using a format string:

//printf is a void method
System.out.printf("%.3f\n",9.541724);   //outs 9.542

//format is a String return method
System.out.println(String.format("%.3f",9.541724)); //outs 9.542

Submission
pass the unit tests

Input
1 1 2 1
1 1 -2 2
1 1 0 0

Output
distance == 1.000
distance == 3.162
distance == 1.414
